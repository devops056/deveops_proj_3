# DevOps_Task_3 (Kubernetes + Dockerfile + Git + Jenkins + Testing)

## Project Tasks:
Perform below task on top of Kubernetes where we use Kubernetes resources like Pods, ReplicaSet, Deployment, PVC and Service.

1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using dockerfile  Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7
2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 
4. Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
5. Job2 : 
    a). By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )
    b).  Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod
    c). Make the data to remain persistent ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )
6. Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.
7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer

## Let's see step by step how to achieve this:

#### Step - 1 -Creat Dockerfile and Build Image, please find the below command, refer these snaps - (creating jenkins image, jenkins image created).
created Dockerfile as per uploded file and builded image using below command and also run it.
```
docker build -t myjenkins:v1 . (here"." means we are running this command from present directory of Dockerfile)
```

#### Step - 2 -Run that Image using below command, refer these snaps - (Jenkins docker run).
```
docker run -it -P -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v /root/.kube:/root/.kube --name myjenkins1 myjenkins:v1
```
(Note: we have attached docker socket and configuration file of base os to perfrom any commnad from jenkins container, -P is for exposing 8080 port)

#### Step - 3 - Login in url of jenkins using below command to find exposed port, please find the below command, refer these snaps - (initial password, Exposed port, use login url and initial password).
```
docker ps
```
-By using base os ip to open jenkins(http://192.168.99.101:32771/)

-Use default password shown in this file (/root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword) 

-Change the admin password then create below jobs

#### Step - 4 - Job-1 -Pull the code from GitHub when developers pushed to Github using poll SCM, please find the below code, refer these snaps - (Github plugin installation, Job-1-snap-1, Job-1-snap-2).
-First of all, install GitHub plugin in jenkins from manage jenkins.

-pull the code from GitHub and run below command to copy those files from jenkins workspace to that folder
```
if ls /home/ | grep code
then
	echo "Directory already present"
else
	sudo mkdir /home/code
fi

sudo rm -rf /home/code/*
sudo cp -rvf * /home/code/
```

#### Step - 5 - Job-2 -this job run if job1 build successfully -it will check code, run respective container(PHP or HTML), please find the below code, refer these snaps - (Job-2-snap-1, Job-2-snap-2, Github php code, PHP code running, Github html code, HTML code running).

```
if sudo ls /home/code/ | grep .php
then
	if sudo kubectl get deployment | grep phpos-deploy
	then
		echo "Deployment is already running"
		sudo kubectl apply -f phpos.yml
		sudo kubectl cp /home/code/*.php phpos-pod:/var/www/html/
    else
		echo "No Deployment is running"
        sudo kubectl create -f phpos.yml
        sudo kubectl cp /home/code/*.php phpos-pod:/var/www/html/
    fi
else
	echo "No PHP code is available"
fi

if sudo ls /home/code/ | grep .html
then
	if sudo kubectl get deployment | grep html-deploy
	then
		echo "Deployment is already running"
		sudo kubectl apply -f htmlos.yml
		sudo kubectl cp /home/code/*.html htmlos-pod:/var/www/html/
	else
		echo "No Deployment is running"
        sudo kubectl create -f htmlos.yml
        sudo kubectl cp /home/code/*.html htmlos-pod:/var/www/html/
    fi
else
	echo "No HTML code is available"
fi
```

#### Step - 6 - Job-3 -this job run if job2 build successfully -it will test the code, it is working or not, refer these snaps - (Job-3-snap-1, Job-3-snap-2).

```
if sudo ls /home/code/ | grep index.php
then
	export status=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" http://192.168.99.101:50000/index.php)
	if [ $status -eq 200 ]
	then
		exit 0
	else
		echo "No PHP code found"
		exit 1
	fi
else
	if sudo ls /home/code/ | grep index.html
	then
		export status1=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" http://192.168.99.101:51000/index.html)
		if [ $status1 -eq 200 ]
		then
			exit 0
		else
			echo "No HTML code found"
			exit 1
		fi
	fi
echo "No suitable code found"
exit 1
fi
```

#### Step - 7 - Job-4 -this job run if job3 build unsuccessful -it will send notification to developer, refer these snaps - (job-4, Code error-failed notification).
```
echo "There is a some error in code or no suitable code found, please refer the logs of job3"
exit 1
```

#### Please refer this snap for build pipeline view - (Build pipeline).
